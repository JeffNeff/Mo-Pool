# MO STACK

Deploy the MineOnlium stack in two commands :)  

# Get started

* `git clone https://github.com/JeffNeff/MO-Stack.git & cd MO-Stack/`
* replace my address with yours in the `.env` file.
* update the PRIVATE_KEY env with a private key and matching ADDRESS
* update the `MO-Stack\Miningcore.UI-master\be\cmd\be\kodata\js\miningcore.js` file (at a minimum just the API variable to reflect your server's public address. )
* `docker compose up` 
* `docker compose -f docker-compose.mc.yml up  -d`
* `docker compose -f docker-compose.bs.yml up  -d`
* ...profit?
